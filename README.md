# FantasticFacts Api

Get fantastic facts about various topics!

This project is created for me to practice deploying a .NET Web API application to production environment.

## Getting Started

```powershell
dotnet run --project FantasticFacts.Api
```

## Data Source

Few years ago when I still subscribed to [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/) newsletter, they will include a random fact in their emails. I found that is interesting so I have collected and saved those facts in a [document](https://1drv.ms/w/c/a1f6618ce10a85b0/EbCFCuGMYfYggKG_aQAAAAABEq5ocJmPVIqpU7sfqZUCdA?e=AjmdkZ).

I document is a Word Document. I use markitdown to convert into [markdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown), do a simple cleanup (eg removes image placeholders) and later is used in the database seeder of this application.

## Deployment
